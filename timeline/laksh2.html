        Queen Victoria's Proclamation of November 1, 1858 declared that thereafter India would be governed 
        by and in the name of the British Monarch through a Secretary of State.Queen Victoria assumed the 
        title of the Empress of India and thus gave the British Government unlimited powers to intervene 
        in the internal affair of the Indian states.The people of India, as such, did not have any say in 
        running the government or formulation of its policies. Consequently, people's disgust with the
        British rule kept mounting, which gave rise to the birth of Indian National Movement.
        Raja Rammohan Roy (1772-1833) founded the Brahmo Samaj in 1828 which aimed at purging the society of
        all its evil practices. He worked for eradicating evils like sati, child marriage and purdah system,
        championed widow marriage and women's education and favoured English system of education in India.
        It was through his effort that sati was declared a legal offence by the British.
        Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) the disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, established the Ramkrishna 
        Mission at Belur in 1897. He championed the supremacy of Vedantic philosophy. His talk at the Chicago 
        (USA) Conference of World Religions in 1893 made the westerners realize the greatness of Hinduism for the first time.
