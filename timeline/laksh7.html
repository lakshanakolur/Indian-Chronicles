                During this movement it was decided that India would celebrate 26th January as Independence Day all over the country. 
                On 26th January 1930,the Congress tricolour was hoisted. Following this,Round Table Conferences were arranged by the British
                and Gandhiji attended the second Round Table Conference at London,but nothing came out of the conference and the Civil
                Disobedience Movement was revived.During this time, Bhagat Singh,Sukhdev and Rajguru were arrested on the charges of
                throwing a bomb in the Central Assembly Hall in Delhi, to demonstrate against the autocratic alien rule. They were hanged 
                to death on March 23, 1931.
