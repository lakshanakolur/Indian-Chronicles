							<h2>Chandra Shekhar Azad</h2>
						</header>
						<p> Chandra Shekhar Azad was the quintessential firebrand revolutionary who fiercely craved independence for his country. A contemporary of Bhagat Singh, Azad never quite received the same levels of adoration for his deeds, yet his actions were no less heroic. His life-long goal was to create as much problem for the British Government as he could. He was the master of disguises and evaded capture by the British police multiple times. His famous proclamation, ‘Dushmano Ki Goliyon Ka Saamna Hum Karenge, /Azad Hi Rahe Hain, aur Azad hi Rahenge’, which translates into ‘I will face the bullets of the enemies, I have been free and I’ll forever be free’, is exemplary of his brand of revolution. He embraced martyrdom like an old friend and inspired a fierce sense of nationalism in the hearts of his contemporaries.<br>Chandra Shekhar Azad’s true legacy lies in his indomitable urge to remain free forever. His name instantly brings into fore, a one man army who shook the foundations of the British Raj.  Azad’s activities inspired awe from his contemporaries and the future generation, who whole-heartedly dedicated their lives to the freedom struggle. At the same time, he became a real problem for the British authorities. What Azad gifted to his countrymen is a fierce longing to be free of the oppressive shackles that British Imperialism was imposing. A grand departure from the non-violent route that Gandhi and the Congress adopted to attain self-rule, Azad’s way of violent usurping freedom set the patriotic sentiments of Indians on fire. He is still remembered as one of the bravest and awe-inspiring figures of Indian armed revolution. The tales of his heroic escape evading capture is the stuff of legends. He dreamt of a free India based on socialist ideals and committed himself towards realizing his dream. His contributions did not lead to immediate freedom, but his grand sacrifice intensified the fire in Indian revolutionaries to fight the British rule even more fiercely.
